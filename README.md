## Introduction ##
This repository contains the code for data analysis and plotting figures of the article, entitled "Compute-first optical detection for noise-resilient visual perception."

## Prerequisite ##
To run the codes, the following python libraries are required:
- Python 3.10
- PyTorch 2.2.0
- numpy 1.26.3
- matplotlib 3.8.0
- tqdm 4.65.0
- scipy 1.11.4

## Usage ##
For each of Figs. 2-5, codes are separated as two python codes:
- *FigN_train.py*: pyTorch-based script for network training, and
- *FigN.py*: script for figure plotting.

Both scripts consist of several cells, which you can run one by one.

The trained network and some heavy data proceesing results are stored in the external [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ySEHtm3InSOBKeDxaLm80hfN4RSsM4ZJ?usp=share_link).
